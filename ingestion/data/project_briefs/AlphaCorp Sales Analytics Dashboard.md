Brief: AlphaCorp Sales Analytics Dashboard

Customer Need:
AlphaCorp identified a gap in their ability to visualize and interpret sales data across their e-commerce platforms. With a vast customer base, they required an intuitive platform to monitor sales performance and identify emerging trends.

Delivered Solution:
We designed a comprehensive Sales Analytics Dashboard that integrates seamlessly with their Inventory Management System. The dashboard offers real-time insights, region-wise sales breakdown, and predictive analytics for sales forecasting.

Technologies Involved:
Built using React for the frontend, the dashboard leverages D3.js for data visualization. The backend, developed in Node.js, fetches data from their existing MongoDB database. AWS services, especially Elastic Beanstalk and RDS, ensure the dashboard's high availability and performance.

Timeline & Customer Experience:
Spanning a period of four months, the project was executed in close collaboration with AlphaCorp's sales team. Post-deployment, AlphaCorp witnessed a 20% improvement in sales strategy adjustments, attributing the success to the insights provided by the dashboard.
